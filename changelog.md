I hope this journal will be useful for whoever out there willing to learn Ruby on Rails from scratch. There is never too late to learn to code.

### 21 September 2020
Day one of re-learning Ruby and Rails from scratch. The last time I wrote any programming code is around 5 years back. This is not gonna be easy, but it will be fun!

- Internet speed of course, is the first obstacle. Suddenly, the speed drop to a ridiculously slow speed
- Which impact my Linux subsystem on Win 10. Updating && upgrading all packages takes approximately 1 hour. That's for 98 MB.

I refuse to give up. I'll just sit here for 3 hours, finding another way to learn Ruby.
I use repl.it while waiting for my Linux subsystem. Learn about string functions and methods. Updating rbenv and ruby, setting up development environment for Win 10 including:
- Ruby 2.7.1 using rbenv
- Setting up git and connecting it to Github
- Installing NodeJS and Yarn package manager
- Installing Rails 6.0.2.2
- Installing PostgreSQL 12.4 on Win 10

**Next: scaffold sample rails app + connect VSCode with subsystem via WSL + continue learn Ruby**

*Total time Spent so far: 3 hours*

### 22 September 2020
Guess what? yeah, internet stucks. This is the second time this happened. To prevent it further, I'll be setting up most of my essential for offline use. That includes Spotify playlist, documentation, etc. The point is, internet access should not hinder me from doing progress.

Fucking internet get in my nerves. Fuck you. I will not be discouraged by you. I'll learn straight from ruby lang documentation.

I learn several things today:
- attr_accessor
- that my internet provider apply transparent proxy, blocking vscode installing any extension. Vpn save the day as always
- Class and instance initialization
- Connect VSCode with WSL via terminal
- Connect Github to VSCode & Win 10

**Next: continue learn ruby from video**

*Total time spent so far: 5.5 hours*
