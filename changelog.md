### 21 September 2020
Day one of re-learning Ruby and Rails from scratch. At this point I flush as much as possible any concept or understanding of Ruby, or other language. I need to do this to 'empty the cup' so I can fill it up back with a fresh lesson. As a matter of fact, I'm fucking dumping everything, including how I supposed to use Git. A brand new sheet.

- Internet speed of course, is the first obstacle. Suddenly, the speed drop to a ridiculously slow speed
- Which impact my Linux subsystem on Win 10. Updating && upgrading all packages takes approximately 1 hour. That's for 98 MB.

I refuse to give up. I'll just sit here for 3 hours, finding another way to learn Ruby.
