I hope this journal will be useful for whoever out there willing to learn Ruby on Rails from scratch. There is never too late to learn to code.

### 21 September 2020
Day one of re-learning Ruby and Rails from scratch. The last time I wrote any programming code is around 5 years back. This is not gonna be easy, but it will be fun!

- Internet speed of course, is the first obstacle. Suddenly, the speed drop to a ridiculously slow speed
- Which impact my Linux subsystem on Win 10. Updating && upgrading all packages takes approximately 1 hour. That's for 98 MB.

I refuse to give up. I'll just sit here for 3 hours, finding another way to learn Ruby.
I use repl.it while waiting for my Linux subsystem. Learn about string functions and methods. Updating rbenv and ruby, setting up development environment for Win 10 including:
- Ruby 2.7.1 using rbenv
- Setting up git and connecting it to Github
- Installing NodeJS and Yarn package manager
- Installing Rails 6.0.2.2
- Installing PostgreSQL 12.4 on Win 10

**Next: scaffold sample rails app + connect VSCode with subsystem via WSL + continue learn Ruby**

*Total time Spent so far: 3 hours*
